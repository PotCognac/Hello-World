# Hello-World
Just another respository
Hi, my name is Joseph Potkonjak. 
I am a film student at Columbia College Chicago that wanted to learn a bit of programming in the final semester of his schooling, so I'm very new to all of it. 
I'm currently 25 years old, still thinking about law school in the future.
